set of all possible edges of a node 
randomly go through the set of edges
actions depend on nodes/switches that are connected to the curr node

create a smaller network for debug purposes

create report: 
    explain the framework (openai)


notes 9/11

consider backtracking
oversee rewards of backtracking
Am I giving it all the info or more of a closed environment
see how you can give all the info to agent


notes 21/11

maybe compare allowing backtracking and not
comparing dynamic and static environments (online offline learning)

next steps:
draft report (structure)
implement environment (dead-end resets and give very bad reward)
evaluate agents in both environments (find a metric)
update the report 
ideas for improvements of the agent, environment (eg. introducing weights to the edges, scale to learn the basics and scale to a different network) 

2 good questions
- Can I apply ml on sp on network
- how good is it
	- metric to be defined
context questions:
- valid network
- in the context of rl what defines a valid network context ( this defined the context of the project )

How did RL involve over time
	- go over major milestones (not too much detail)

Revise NetworkGeneration what is a network

- in internet network we have dual-link, 1 connection 


notes 7/12

Report the aproaches we took and what was the outcomes and why did it not work in the end

notes 15/12

talk about the gols, limitations, problems

(if I want to continue with this project show that we want to work with deep learning)

!!come up with some networks (diff complexity) and see how the agent performs on them (avg time)
